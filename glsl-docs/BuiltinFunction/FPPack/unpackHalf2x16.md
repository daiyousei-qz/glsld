Returns a two-component floating-point vector with components obtained by unpacking a 32-bit unsigned integer into a pair of 16-bit values, interpreting those values as 16-bit floating-point numbers according to the API, and converting them to 32-bit floating-point values.

The first component of the vector is obtained from the 16 least-significant bits of v; the second component is obtained from the 16 most-significant bits of v.
