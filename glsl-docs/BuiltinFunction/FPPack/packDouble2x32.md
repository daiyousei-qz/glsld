Returns a double-precision value obtained by packing the components of v into a 64-bit value. If an IEEE 754 Inf or NaN is created, it will not signal, and the resulting floating-point value is unspecified. Otherwise, the bit-level representation of v is preserved. The first vector component specifies the 32 least significant bits; the second component specifies the 32 most significant bits.
