Returns an unsigned integer obtained by converting the components of a two-component floating-point vector to the 16-bit floating-point representation of the API, and then packing these two 16-bit integers into a 32-bit unsigned integer.

The first vector component specifies the 16 least-significant bits of the result; the second component specifies the 16 most-significant bits.
