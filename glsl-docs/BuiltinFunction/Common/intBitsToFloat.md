Returns a floating-point value corresponding to a signed or unsigned integer encoding of a floating-point value. If a NaN is passed in, it will not signal, and the resulting value is unspecified. If an Inf is passed in, the resulting value is the corresponding Inf. Otherwise, the bit-level representation is preserved.
