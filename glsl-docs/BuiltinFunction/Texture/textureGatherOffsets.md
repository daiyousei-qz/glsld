Operate identically to textureGatherOffset except that offsets is used to determine the location of the four texels to sample. Each of the four texels is obtained by applying the corresponding offset in offsets as a (u, v) coordinate offset to P, identifying the four-texel LINEAR footprint, and then selecting the texel i0 j0 of that footprint. The specified values in offsets must be constant integral expressions.
