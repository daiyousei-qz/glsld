Do a texture lookup as in texture but with offset added to the (u,v,w) texel coordinates before looking up each texel. The offset value must be a constant expression. A limited range of offset values are supported; the minimum and maximum offset values are implementation-dependent and given by gl_MinProgramTexelOffset and gl_MaxProgramTexelOffset, respectively.

Note that offset does not apply to the layer coordinate for texture arrays. This is explained in detail in section 8.14.2 “Coordinate Wrapping and Texel Selection” of the OpenGL Specification, where offset is (δu, δv, δw).
Note that texel offsets are also not supported for cube maps.
