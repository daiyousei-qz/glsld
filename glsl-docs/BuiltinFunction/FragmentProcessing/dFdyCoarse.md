Returns the partial derivative of p with respect to the window y coordinate. Will use local differencing based on the value of p for the current fragmentâ€™s neighbors, and will possibly, but not necessarily, include the value of p for the current fragment. That is, over a given area, the implementation can compute y derivatives in fewer unique locations than would be allowed for dFdyFine(p).
