Returns the value of the input interpolant variable sampled at an offset from the center of the pixel specified by offset. The two floating-point components of offset, give the offset in pixels in the x and y directions, respectively.

An offset of (0, 0) identifies the center of the pixel. The range and granularity of offsets supported by this function is implementation-dependent.
