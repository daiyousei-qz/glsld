Returns the dimensions of the image or images bound to image. For arrayed images, the last component of the return value will hold the size of the array. Cube images only return the dimensions of one face, and the number of cubes in the cube map array, if arrayed.

Note: The qualification readonly writeonly accepts a variable qualified with readonly, writeonly, both, or neither. It means the formal argument will be used for neither reading nor writing to the underlying memory.
