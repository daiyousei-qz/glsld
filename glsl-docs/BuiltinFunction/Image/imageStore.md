Stores data into the texel at the coordinate P from the image specified by image. For multisample stores, the sample number is given by sample. When image, P, and sample identify a valid texel, the bits used to represent data are converted to the format of the image unit in the manner described in section 8.26 “Texture Image Loads and Stores” of the OpenGL Specification and stored to the specified texel.
